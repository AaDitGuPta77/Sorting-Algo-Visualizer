# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 🚀

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**, an interactive tool designed to help users visualize key sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more. This project was built to provide real-time animations and insights into how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Key Features

- 🎥 **Dynamic Sorting Animation**: Visualize the inner workings of each sorting algorithm in real-time, step by step.
- 🌗 **Light & Dark Modes**: Switch between light and dark themes for an enhanced viewing experience.
- ⚛️ **Real-Time State Management**: Efficient state management using React.js for smooth and optimized user interaction.
- 🎨 **Icon-Based Themes**: A modern and intuitive interface with easily recognizable icons.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for interactive and responsive UI.
- **CSS** for styling and theme integration.
- **JavaScript** for algorithm logic and sorting visualizations.
